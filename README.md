# Microservices Architecture Templates

This repository provides a set of templates for creating microservices using popular tools and technologies, including **FastAPI**, **Kafka**, **Redis**, **gRPC**, **RabbitMQ**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Elasticsearch**. Each microservice template is organized as a Git submodule for modularity and easy integration.

## Introduction
This repository aims to simplify the development of microservices by offering pre-configured templates for commonly used technologies. Each submodule provides a separate, self-contained microservice with a defined purpose. These templates are designed to work together but can also be used independently based on your requirements.

## Architecture Overview
This microservice architecture is designed with scalability, modularity, and asynchronous communication in mind. Each service template here is configured to handle specific functions, such as data storage, message streaming, inter-service communication, and API management. The architecture encourages a loosely-coupled design where services can be independently scaled, updated, or replaced.

## Templates Included
Here is a breakdown of each technology and its intended role in the microservices architecture:

### FastAPI
FastAPI is used to build RESTful APIs with asynchronous capabilities. It provides a high-performance API server that can serve as an entry point or gateway to your microservices.

### Kafka
Kafka is a distributed message streaming platform, ideal for real-time data processing and asynchronous service communication. This template sets up Kafka for event-driven interactions between microservices.

### Redis
Redis is used for caching and message brokering. It helps optimize response times by storing frequently accessed data and handling lightweight, fast messaging scenarios between services.

### gRPC
gRPC enables high-performance, language-agnostic Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) between microservices. The gRPC template is pre-configured for handling inter-service communication with low latency and strong data serialization.

### RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is a message broker suited for complex routing, fan-out, and task queue scenarios. This template provides a flexible, reliable way to handle asynchronous communication within your architecture.

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database. This template provides a scalable data storage solution that can be integrated with various microservices to handle structured data.

### Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is used for indexing and search capabilities. This template configures an Elasticsearch instance for fast, full-text searching across large data sets, making it ideal for log analysis, analytics, and search functionalities.

## Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies for each submodule** as described in their respective folders.

2. **Configure environment variables as required**. Each template includes a sample `.env` file with necessary configuration keys.

## Running the Services
Each service can be run independently. Check each templateâ€™s folder for specific instructions. Below is a general approach:

- **Docker Compose**: If available, use Docker Compose to spin up services in isolated containers.
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```
- **Manual Start**: Run each service manually if Docker is not an option, following the instructions provided in each template.
